On Day 13, the focus shifted from learning new features to mastering one of the most critical skills for any developer: **debugging**. Writing code is only half the battle; finding and fixing bugs is the other half. This day was dedicated to a systematic approach to identifying, reproducing, and resolving errors in our programs.

## 1. Describe the Problem

The first and most important step in debugging is to clearly describe the problem. Before you can fix a bug, you must understand what the code is *supposed* to do and how its actual behavior differs from that expectation.

-   **Exercise**: We started by analyzing a piece of code with a logical error. The task was to answer key questions: What is the loop's purpose? Under what condition should a specific message be printed? What assumptions are we making about the variables? By articulating the problem, we could pinpoint the flawed logic and fix it.

## 2. Reproduce the Bug Reliably

Some bugs are inconsistent, appearing only under specific conditions. A crucial part of debugging is finding a way to **reliably reproduce the bug**. If you can make the bug appear on command, you can test your fixes and be confident when it's resolved.

-   **Exercise**: We were given code with an occasional error. The first task was to modify the code to ensure the bug happened every single time. Once the bug was reproducible, it was much easier to diagnose the root cause (often related to data types or edge cases) and implement a permanent fix.

## 3. Play Computer: Trace the Execution

A powerful mental exercise for debugging is to "play computer." This involves reading your code line by line, step by step, and manually tracking the value of each variable as if you were the computer executing the program. This process often reveals where your mental model of the code differs from what is actually happening.

-   **Exercise**: We were given a function that didn't work correctly for a specific input (the year 1994). By manually tracing the execution path, we could see exactly which conditional statements were being triggered and why the logic was failing, which led directly to the fix.

## 4. Fix Obvious Errors and Catch Exceptions

### Syntax Errors
Modern IDEs like PyCharm are excellent at catching syntax errors before you even run the code, usually highlighting them with a red underline. The first line of defense is always to fix these obvious errors. While warnings (yellow underlines) are optional, they often point to potential future problems.

### Handling Runtime Errors with `try`/`except`
Sometimes, errors occur not because the syntax is wrong, but because of the data the program receives at runtime (e.g., a user entering text where a number is expected). To prevent these situations from crashing the entire program, we learned to use `try`/`except` blocks.

-   **How it works**: You place the code that might cause an error inside the `try` block. In the `except` block, you define what should happen if that specific error occurs. This allows your program to handle the error gracefully instead of crashing.

-   **Exercise**: We fixed a bug where an incorrect data type would cause a crash. By wrapping the problematic code in a `try`/`except TypeError` block, we could catch the error and handle it without stopping the program.

## 5. Use `print()` as Your Friend

One of the simplest yet most effective debugging tools is the `print()` statement. You can place `print()` statements at various points in your code to inspect the values of variables at different stages of execution, especially inside loops and complex functions. This helps you see the "intermediate values" and understand how your program's state is changing over time.

-   **Exercise**: We diagnosed a program that was supposed to calculate a total but was giving no output. By strategically placing `print()` statements, we could see what was happening inside the function and identify that a variable was not being updated as expected, leading to a quick fix.

## 6. Using a Professional Debugger

While `print()` is useful, a real **debugger** is like `print()` on steroids. Most IDEs come with a built-in debugger that allows you to pause your program's execution at specific points and inspect everything.

### Key Debugger Concepts
-   **Breakpoint**: A marker you place on a line of code. When you run the program in debug mode, it will pause execution at this line, allowing you to inspect the state of all variables.
-   **Step Over**: Executes the current line of code and moves to the next line in the same file.
-   **Step Into**: If the current line is a function call, this will move the debugger into that function so you can inspect its internal execution.

-   **Exercise**: We used the PyCharm debugger to set a breakpoint and step through a faulty program line by line. This allowed us to watch the values of variables change in real-time and instantly spot where the logic went wrong.
