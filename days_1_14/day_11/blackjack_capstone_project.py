# Our Blackjack Game House Rules
# - The deck is unlimited in size.
# - There are no jokers.
# - The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
# - The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
# - Use the following list as the deck of cards:
# cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

# - The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
# - Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
# - The computer is the dealer.
